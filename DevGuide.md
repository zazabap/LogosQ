Collecting workspace information# LogosQ Development Guide

This guide is designed to help developers contribute to LogosQ, a quantum computing library written in Rust. Whether you're experienced with quantum computing or just getting started, your contributions are welcome!

## Project Overview

[LogosQ](https://github.com/zazabap/logosq.git) is a comprehensive quantum computing library developed in Rust, inspired by established libraries like [QPP](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0208073) (C++), [Yao.jl](https://yaoquantum.org/) (Julia), and [Pennylane](https://pennylane.ai/) (Python).

The name Î»ÏŒÎ³Î¿Ï‚ (lÃ³gos) comes from Greek meaning "logic."

## Development Roadmap

- ðŸ“… Integration with other quantum frameworks

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (latest stable version)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- For visualization features: `libfontconfig1-dev` and `pkg-config` (on Debian/Ubuntu)

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zazabap/logosq.git
   cd logosq
   ```

2. Install dependencies (for Ubuntu/Debian):
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -y libfontconfig1-dev pkg-config
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

4. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   cargo test
   ```

## How to Contribute

### Areas Needing Help

1. **Algorithm Implementation**: Help implement quantum algorithms in the `src/algorithms/` module
2. **Testing**: Expand test coverage across all modules
3. **Documentation**: Improve code documentation and examples
4. **Visualization**: Enhance visualization capabilities for complex quantum states and circuits
5. **Performance Optimization**: Help make simulations faster and more efficient

### Contribution Workflow

1. **Find an issue**: Look for issues labeled "good first issue" or "help wanted" in the GitHub repository
2. **Fork the repository**: Create your own fork of the project
3. **Create a branch**: Make a new branch for your feature or bugfix
4. **Make changes**: Implement your feature or fix the bug
5. **Write tests**: Add tests for your new functionality
6. **Update documentation**: Ensure your code is well-documented
7. **Submit a PR**: Create a pull request with a clear description of your changes

### Coding Standards

- Follow Rust's official [style guidelines](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.0.0/style/README.html)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write clear documentation comments (use  for doc comments)
- Include unit tests for new functionality
- Format your code with `rustfmt`
- Check your code with `clippy`

## Community

- **GitHub Issues**: For bug reports and feature requests
- **Pull Requests**: For submitting contributions
- **Discussions**: For broader conversations about the project's direction
